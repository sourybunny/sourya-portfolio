              Most students had a hard time finding features due to poor

              Advisors find it difficult to download and organize to keep track

            Advisors mentioned they often spend time looking for previous plans
            submitted by students to compare with latest changes based on
            recommendations. I created a threaded comment view that shows the
            timestamp of each comment with a snapshot of the student‚Äôs plan.

            Since advisors have a busy schedule, It was difficult to recruit for
            testing. So, I managed to test with my interview participants and
            sent out a Qualtrics survey to the rest of the advisors that
            received 120+ responses.

            I recruited students and did 2 remote moderated tests while sending

            students.

            While advisors were able to discover main actions, the screen itself
            posed a challenge due to information overload. They liked that they
            are able to compare old plans but way it was presented is
            overwhelming.

          Our team did multiple demoes during the project to academic owners and
          other stakeholders. Everyone was positive and excited to use the
          system for the upcoming semester. We developed an MVP in 2 months and
          released the interface to 1500 students initially.

              We were hard on time and decided to take a step by step approach
              by prioritizing necessary functionalities that address the needs
              and solve the problems of our users. This helped me to be focused
              and goal oriented than building a feature rich system.

              Being a developer once, It was easy for me to realize the
              development efforts for each feature. Communicating with
              developers during every step by attending PBRs helped me
              understand their challenges and limitations. I tried to integrate
              designs in an existing system rather than building something from
              scratch.
