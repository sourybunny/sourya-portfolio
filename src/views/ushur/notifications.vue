                Any discrepancy in the launched apps would frustrate the
                customers and cause drop-offs, meaning developers needed to be

              I prototyped different motion designs to our team to get feedback
              on a read/unread visual indicator. After discussing, we believed
              it would be meaningful to allow the user to mark a notification as
              read or unread for refering it back. As a team, we came up with a
              <span class="font-weight-medium"
                >framework on when a notification will be marked as read.</span
              >

              After presenting the concept with product managers, although we
              collectively chose concept #3 as the right direction to go forward,
              the API was still at an early stage and had a limitation of being
              able to generate only 3 recommendations at a time based off of
              original text. This led us to choose a different design direction
              and scoping the concept #3 one to future.

              However, some projects might have a smaller scope and due to the
              strict timeline and research team bandwidth, we probably won't
              have research reports or resources directly related to our
              project. We can do our own research such as competitive analysis,
              dogfooding, flow analysis, and then list Jobs-to-be-done (JTBDs)
              and validate them with stakeholders.

              Although we had only a week's time for the project, sharing the
              design direction often with stakeholders helped us to stay
              anchored to the MVP and realize the technical capabilities early
              on. Communicating frequently (yes over communication is
              appreciated üòÅ) with your cross-function team members can help us
              gather more context and insights in the project problem space, and
              having regular syncs with them is the key step to achieve
              alignments, especially if we want to tackle problems on a system
              level.
