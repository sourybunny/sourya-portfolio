                For the last 3 years, I've been working with diverse companies
                under many roles in digital product design. This
                interdisciplinary experience taught me how design processes
                could influence product and business decisions. These insights
                allow me to use design as a strategy rather than being just
                another deliverable.

                  As a child, I spent most of my play time solving puzzles and
                  building stuff. I love transforming material to bring life to
                  them. Over the years, these problem-solving skills shaped my
                  design mindset to tweak pixels in the digital world to
                  handcraft delightful experiences. I love to work during the
                  'metamorphosis'(like a butterfly) to bring products from idea
                  to life.

                  Apart from UX Design, I love to play around with HTML and CSS
                  to create fun interactions. My software engineering background
                  taught me all about web and helped me build this site using
                  Javascript and VueJs.

                  There were times I put on multiple hats while working for tech
                  startups. This experience helped me master development and
                  team-working skills. I can effectively communicate my designs
                  with product owners, developers and stakeholders at all levels
                  and work iteratively by receiving feedback.
